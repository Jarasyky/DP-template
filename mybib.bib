	abstract = {This paper presents a narrative review of research literature to “map the landscape” of the mechanisms of the effect of sound vibration on humans including the physiological, neurological, and biochemical. It begins by narrowing music to sound and sound to vibration. The focus is on low frequency sound (up to 250 Hz) including infrasound (1–16 Hz). Types of application are described and include whole body vibration, vibroacoustics, and focal applications of vibration. Literature on mechanisms of response to vibration is categorized into hemodynamic, neurological, and musculoskeletal. Basic mechanisms of hemodynamic effects including stimulation of endothelial cells and vibropercussion; of neurological effects including protein kinases activation, nerve stimulation with a specific look at vibratory analgesia, and oscillatory coherence; of musculoskeletal effects including muscle stretch reflex, bone cell progenitor fate, vibration effects on bone ossification and resorption, and anabolic effects on spine and intervertebral discs. In every category research on clinical applications are described. The conclusion points to the complexity of the field of vibrational medicine and calls for specific comparative research on type of vibration delivery, amount of body or surface being stimulated, effect of specific frequencies and intensities to specific mechanisms, and to greater interdisciplinary cooperation and focus.},

exposure can cause health problems and therefore it is important that the worker’s noise
exposure is assessed. This may require measurement by an equipment manufacturer or the
employer. Human exposure to noise may be measured using microphones; however, weighting
filters are required to correlate the physical noise sound pressure level measurements to
the human’s response to an auditory stimulus. {IEC} 61672-1 and {ANSI} S1.43 describe suitable
weighting filters, but do not explain how to implement them for digitally recorded sound
pressure level data. By using the bilinear transform, it is possible to transform the
analogue equations given in the standards into digital filters. This paper describes the
implementation of the weighting filters as digital {IIR} (Infinite Impulse Response) filters
and provides all the necessary formulae to directly calculate the filter coefficients for
any sampling frequency. Thus, the filters in the standards can be implemented in any
numerical processing software (such as a spreadsheet or programming language running on a
{PC}, mobile device or embedded system).},

	rights = {info:eu-repo/semantics/{openAccess}},
	url = {https://arcadia.sba.uniroma3.it/handle/2307/4525},
	abstract = {Flows past wall-mounted cavities are found in a wide variety of applications, 
including side-branches, organ pipes, automobile sunroofs, inter-car gaps in trains and 
aircraft bays. Under certain conditions, flow excited cavities can generate large pressure 
fluctuations, undesirable noise and significant structural loads. To date, most of the studies 
have been focused on rectangular cavities while little attention has been given to cylindrical 
cavities despite their widespread use. 
Two different types of cylindrical cavities were experimentally investigated in low 
speed wind tunnels: an open mouth cavity and a deep cavity with a small rectangular 
opening. The measurements included hot wire anemometry, particle image velocimetry ({PIV}) 
and unsteady surface pressure measurements. Additionally, numerical analysis of the test 
section/cavity systems were carried out with the finite element program {COMSOL} 
Multiphysics and with a wave expansion method ({WEM}) code developed by the Trinity 
College Dublin. 
Important flow features are described by evaluating the pressure measurements 
conducted in several positions over the walls of an open mouth cavity, the {PIV} measurements 
performed over horizontal planes inside the cavity and the hot-wire measurements on the 
shear layer and on the wake of the cavity. 
Pressure Fourier spectra evidence the presence of the first three shear layer 
hydrodynamic modes at frequencies well predicted by classical formulation for rectangular 
cavities (Rossiter). When the cavity is open, the acoustic modes of the test section are found 
to be excited by the flow but when the cavity is partially covered, the shear layer 
hydrodynamic modes are more likely to lock on the natural frequencies of the cavity. The 
position of the opening has an influence on the lock-on acoustic modes. 
The acoustic energy generated by the shear layer is calculated by applying the vortex 
sound theory of Howe: the flow velocity and the vorticity are extracted from the {PIV} data and 
the acoustic particle velocity field from the {WEM} calculation. The acoustic sources are 
localised in space and quantified over an acoustic period providing insight into the sound 
production of flow-excited partially covered cylindrical cavities.},

Each resonator was made into an analysis model with the same resonance frequency set. This analysis model is used to predict the performance of each resonator before proceeding with the actual experiment. According to the user's request, the band to reduce the noise is set, and the resonator is modeled accordingly. The ducts were used to position the resonator in the middle of the duct, and the performance of each resonator was compared when the same noise was applied. It can be helpful to design before resonator production by confirming by using analysis model whether noise reduction occurs well in the band that wanted to reduce noise. },

	abstract = {During commissioning of an open-casing test rig, a loud (above 105 {dB}) high pitch “squealing” sound occurred at speeds above 3,000 rpm. All elements of the rig were removed except the bearings yet the noise persisted. Microphone measurements show the sound occurring in the frequency range between 3,000 and 5,000 Hz, while proximity sensors and accelerometers showed very small amounts of vibration of the shaft in this frequency range. After investigations into bearing rub proved negative, the cause of the sound was determined to be an excitation of acoustic resonances arising from air passing over the balance holes on the seal disk. Duct tape placed over the balance holes completely eliminated the noise. An investigation into vortex shedding, confirms that a Strouhal number of 0.4 shows vortices will begin to form on the disk at speeds of 3,000 rpm at a frequency of 3,500 Hz.},

	abstract = {An investigation is conducted on the acoustic resonance that develops in rectangular and cylindrical cavities with rigid walls. An analytical model for the small amplitude acoustic perturbations inside an enclosure with rigid walls is developed from classical linerized acoustics. The method is first applied to a rectangular geometry and the normalized mode shapes and frequencies of the first six standing wave modes are given. The results are used to diagnose whether coupling is likely to occur between the first two Rossiter modes and the acoustic standing waves, which may lead to a reinforcement of the flow instability. At the selected test conditions, the method indicates that the second Rossiter mode can couple with the first longitudinal acoustic mode. The acoustic resonant mode predictions for a cylindrical cavity of length to depth ratios 0.71 and 2.5, tested at near-incompressible speeds, suggest that the acoustic resonant modes and the main fluid dynamic instability in the enclosure are sufficiently apart in frequency not to strongly interact with one another. The parametrized analytical solutions developed in this study enable the aero-acoustic engineer to diagnose whether coupling between a given fluid dynamic instability and acoustic resonance is likely to affect a rectangular or cylindrical cavity component.},
